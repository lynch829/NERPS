Welcome to NeRPS! NeRPS stands for Neutron Radiation Physics Simulator. NeRPS is a monte-carlo code for neutron radiation
transport. Currently, its primary focus is for simulating activation of isotopes due to thermal neutron fluxes. The user 
will be able to define geometries, materials and neutron energy spectrums. This project is still early in development.
